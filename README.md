# Math Parser Swift
Library which evaluates mathematical expression stored in string. Library is written in Swift v1.2.
It changes something like this: "1234769.1234*1238746-1234(-12)^2" to this: 1,529,565,134,839.26. Some would say it's pure magic!

A Java fork of the library is available here: https://github.com/Sourcegasm/Math-Parser-Java
